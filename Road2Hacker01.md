# 🔐 Content Strategy for Cybersecurity on X

## 1. Define Your Content Pillars

Stick to 3–5 themes so your audience knows what to expect:

Cybersecurity tips for individuals

Common threats in Kenya/Africa (local context is powerful)

Career advice in cybersec

Tools & techniques (e.g. Wireshark, Kali, Burp Suite)

Industry news explained simply

## 2. Post Format Mix

Threads: Deep dives (e.g. “How phishing works and how to spot it”)

Quick tips: “Never reuse passwords. A single leak can cost you everything.”

News + commentary: “Kenya’s eCitizen breach: what we know and what it means”

Polls: “What’s your biggest cybersecurity concern?”

Memes: Humor is engaging, even in cyber.

## 3. Post Consistently

Start with 3–4 posts per week. Use scheduling tools like Typefully, Hypefury, or Buffer.

🧠 Tips to Grow as a Cybersecurity Creator

Use simple language. Your goal is clarity, not complexity.

Focus on storytelling: “I once found a student using ‘123456’ as a password...”

Use local context (M-Pesa fraud, KRA scams, etc.)

Engage with followers: reply, like, retweet comments

Follow and interact with other cybersecurity creators globally
